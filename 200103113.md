I am very keen to know and learn new things about coding. I have been learing some or the other kind of languages since class 7. The first thing I learnt was HTML, then c++, c, java, sql, python. I have basic knowledge in all these languages and therefore I am always very excited to learn more about them. I have just started competitive coding and I find it very satisfying after I complete a submission.
Some of my achievements:
1. I scored 100/100 in computer applications in class 10 (ICSE board).
2. I scored 95/100 in computer science in class 12 (CBSE board).
3. I used to teach c++ and python to some of my neighbour kids.
